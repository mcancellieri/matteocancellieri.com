        <h1>The Scary Ones playing card bonus page</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for purchasing these monstrous cards and visiting the bonus page! I hope you enjoy playing with
            them
            as much as I enjoyed creating them.

            As a recap: you have 40 cards with 4 different suits, each numbered from 1 to 10. The design follows the
            Italian
            style, with the 8, 9, and 10 representing the soldier, the knight, and the king, respectively. The suits
            broadly
            represent the worlds where the monsters belong. You can identify each suit by its color and the symbol
            beneath
            the number:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
    <span style="color: #e6007e">
        <li>
            Underworld (bone)
        </li>
    </span>
            <span style="color: #312783">
        <li>
            Middle world (drop of blood)
        </li>
    </span>
            <span style="color: #00aae9">
        <li>
            Human world (wrench)
        </li>
    </span>
            <span style="color: #009640">
        <li>
            Other world (spaceship)
        </li>
    </span>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are plenty of games you can play with these cards simply made up or from the Italian tradition. The
            following are instructions <i>monstrify-ed</i> for your scary games.
        </p>

        <h2 id="scarystories">
            Scary stories (3 or more players)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Deal 5 cards to each player. In turns, each player places one card face-up on the table. The last player to
            place a card becomes the storyteller and must create a story using all the cards. The story can be scary,
            funny,
            or absurd, but must mention each monster at least once.
            After the story ends, players vote on its quality. For each vote, the storyteller claims a card from the
            story.
            Every player draws another card and you keep going until all cards are gone. The winner is the player that
            has
            the highest monster points.
        </p>
        <h2 id="poo">
            Poo (2 to 10 players)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Start by selecting groups of cards with the same face value, a group of for equal to the number of players.
            Shuffle and deal them, placing the remaining cards in the middle. Each turn, players pass a card to the
            left.
            The goal is to collect 4 cards of the same number. When you succeed, your monsters are ready! Shout "Poo!"
            and
            put your hand on the discard pile. All other players must follow regardless of what they have in their
            hands.
            The last one to land on the pile “cleans the poo”.
            To determine how much poo they collect, draw a card from the middle pile. Once the deck is finished, the
            player
            with the least poos wins.
        </p>
        <h2 id="monsteroverlord">
            Monster overloard (more than 3 players)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Select one card as the Monster Overlord one as the Guard Master and pick one card for each of the remaining
            players they will be the subjects. Shuffle and deal one card to each player, place the rest in the middle.
            The Overlord winks to subjugate others, while the Guard Master tries to catch them. If the Overlord winks at
            you, declare yourself a subject and flip your card. The Guard Master can accuse and arrest the Overlord, but
            a wrong accusation means instant loss.
            The Overlord wins by subjugating all players except the Guard Master. Losers draw "years in prison”, and the
            player with the least prison time wins.
        </p>
        <h2 id="monsteroverlord">
            Monster overlord (more than 3 players)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Select one card as the Monster Overlord one as the Guard Master and pick one card for each of the remaining
            players they will be the subjects. Shuffle and deal one card to each player, place the rest in the middle.
            The Overlord winks to subjugate others, while the Guard Master tries to catch them. If the Overlord winks at

            a wrong accusation means instant loss.
            The Overlord wins by subjugating all players except the Guard Master. Losers draw "years in prison”, and the
            player with the least prison time wins.

        <h2 id="brriscola">

        </h2>

        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <p>Deal 3 cards to each player and reveal 1 card to set the trump suit (Brrrr-iscola).</p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Players take turns playing a card.
            The highest card of the leading suit wins, unless a trump (Briscola) card is played, in which case the
            highest
            trump wins.
            The winner of the trick draws first from the remaining deck, followed by others.
        </p>
        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p> Add up the points from collected cards.
            The player/team with 61 or more points wins.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Playing in two or in four</h3>
        <p> When playing in 4 (or even in 6) you play in a team with the person opposite you. Strategise and play the
            teamwork in your favour.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            High monsters card (Ace, 3) are very valuable, so try to win them with strong Briscola cards or by playing high cards of the leading world.
            Pay attention to which cards have been played, especially in the briscola suit.
